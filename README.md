# Predator Fabric

A completely redesigned variant of Predator intended to feed information to an external service.


## Disclaimer

While Predator is designed to be as reliable and accurate as possible, license plate recognition isn't an exact science. As such, you shouldn't depend on Predator for safety or security critical tasks.


## Description

Automated license plate recognition (often abbreviated to ALPR) is the practice of using a camera and computer to automatically detect, process, and read vehicle license plates. Predator Fabric is a completely re-written variation of the Predator ALPR system, designed to stream license plate information to an external service to automatically trigger events and actions.


## Features

### Offline

All image processing and analysis can be done entirely on-device, and the results of analysis are only sent to the designated network service. This means Predator Fabric can operate without a connection to the internet, and only feed information to local services, if desired.

### Easy

Predator Fabric is designed to be as easy to set-up and use as possible. Anyone with basic computer knowledge shouldn't have a problem getting everything up and running.

### Customizable

While the standard configuration focuses on simiplicity, technical users can use the advanced configuration options to extensive modify, debug, and repair the platform.
