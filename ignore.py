# This library is responsible to handling 'ignore lists', which allows administrators to define a list of license plates that should be ignored.

# Ignore lists might be used to prevent common vehicles from being logged in order to keep logs organized, or to prevent privacy-concerned visitors from having their license plate processed.

# License plates in the ignore list are still processed locally, but won't be sent to an external service.

# Ignore lists can be enabled and disabled in the configuration.
